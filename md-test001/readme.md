***aUSD Ecosystem Fund launch, ACA Staking now live, Acala Ecosystem announcements: Talisman and Kujira, and Wormhole integration in March’s update***.  

It’s been an exciting month for Acala. March began with the encouraging news the Acala community has bridged over 1M DOT following the on-way bridge [launch in February](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/acala-enables-dot-bridge-in-preparation-for-defi-economy-9e5a4a18f4c3). With ‘Phase 3’ of the roadmap in full effect, March has seen a significant expansion of aUSD programs and accessibility to shared liquidity and cross-chain functionality for Acala and Karura ecosystems via the recently announced Wormhole bridge integration.  

**Following excellent progress this month, here’s a recap of the biggest news!**.  

***Polkadot Parachains and Venture Funds Team Up to Launch $250 Million’ aUSD Ecosystem Fund’***.  

Acala, with the support of other Polkadot parachains and venture funds, launched a $250 Million aUSD Ecosystem Fund to grow Polkadot’s native stablecoin, aUSD. The fund aims to support Solidity or Substrate-based applications or parachains that will drive yield and utility for aUSD. Developers with use cases in money markets, DEXs, derivatives, asset management, DAOs, payments, and other practical aUSD applications can apply to receive aUSD Ecosystem funding [here](https://acala.network/ecosystem-program).  

aUSD provides a safe, reliable currency to power an ecosystem of hundreds of connected Polkadot parachains to facilitate economic activity. Through implementing an over-collateralized, crypto-backed, decentralized mechanism, aUSD’s primary goal is to support every Parachain and DApp in Polkadot and Kusama with a decentralized stable currency and become the default quote and routing asset in the DotSama ecosystem, helping Polkadot unlock its full potential. A healthy economy needs a healthy level of debt to maximize growth potential. aUSD allows users to unlock liquidity from their reserve and staked assets. Locked and staked DOT tokens cannot be utilized further in the DOT economy; as such, aUSD enables liquidity to be drawn from reserve assets to leverage additional Polkadot DeFi activities.  

The aUSD Ecosystem Fund promotes the development of blockchain technology and the growth of Polkadot by empowering developers to create solutions across various industries that drive aUSD yield and utility. The fund supports development teams by:   

  * Raising capital for development from industry-leading funds
  * Building support from Acala’s engineering team for Solidity and Substrate-based projects
  * Increasing TVL by injecting aUSD liquidity into projects
  * Help in the growth and expansion of a project through networking opportunities created by the fund
  * Allowing projects to leverage marketing around the fund to grow their brands.
